<i><b>Hello World!!</b></i> Although I already have a website, I would love to create my own from scratch that serves as a portfolio for my photography, poetry, and videos. As a result, I would love to put images, a video or two, and text on my website.

    <h1><b>Trivia Facts</b></h1>  
<p> 
The site that I currently have is an adobe portfolio. <i>I'm curious as to how such free domains work and if the host service such as Adobe owns the server and they just host multiple sites to it.</i>  
Part of my interest in photography comes from my parents who are professionals and used to shoot weddings for over a decade. My dad is also able to code and maintains his own website which I think is really cool, and hope to follow in his footsteps.

 When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence."
